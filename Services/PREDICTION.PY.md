### Purpose

This service predicts **how many EVs will be registered** in a geographic area (ZCTA), used as a demand proxy for charging.

---

## Main Function: `predict_ev_registrations(zcta)`

### What it does:

1. Takes a **ZCTA code** (ZIP-level area)

2. Looks up:
    
    - Total population
    
    - State-level EV adoption curves
    
    - Market trends
    
3. Returns an **integer value**: the estimated EV registrations in that area.

### Error Handling:

- Returns exceptions like `TypeError`, `ValueError` if ZIP is invalid

- Other internal errors are caught and wrapped in an `ApiException` (via the router)

## Used In:

- `roi.py` â†’ to simulate demand and traffic

- `competition.py` may also use this to compare demand zones
